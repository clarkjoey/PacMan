# PacMan
This is the PacMan project I learned how to build in Week 4 of my MIT masters certificate

## Description: 
This project is to recreate a famous arcade game and show how javascript can work with HTML to make a game. You'll see examples of variables, arrays, functions, and how they all work together. 

## Installation: 
No installation steps at this time.

## Usage: 
This program should create a PacMan that bounces from wall to wall and open and closes it's mouth. The goal is to eventually add more elements to this code!
